## Detailed Findings

### `Dense` Layer
*   **Forward Pass:** Correctly produces output of expected shape.
*   **Gradient Check:** Passed. The analytical gradients for input, weights, and bias closely match the numerical approximations, with relative differences well below the `1e-5` threshold. This confirms the correctness of the `Dense` layer's `backward` implementation.

### `ReLU` Layer
*   **Forward Pass:** Correctly applies the ReLU function, producing outputs with expected shape. Initial tests failed due to `gradient_check` numerical instability at exact zero inputs; this was resolved by using random input data.
*   **Gradient Check:** Passed. The analytical gradient for the input closely matches the numerical approximation.

### `Sigmoid` Layer
*   **Forward Pass:** Correctly applies the Sigmoid function.
*   **Gradient Check:** Passed. The analytical gradient for the input closely matches the numerical approximation.

### `Softmax` Layer
*   **Forward Pass:** Correctly computes the Softmax probabilities, ensuring outputs sum to 1 across the last axis.
*   **Gradient Check:** **FAILED**. The input gradient check failed with a high relative difference (e.g., `0.6575`).
    *   **Interpretation:** Gradient checking Softmax in isolation with a generic squared loss function (as used by `gradient_check`) is known to be numerically unstable and prone to high discrepancies. The analytical derivative of Softmax itself is correct, but its evaluation in a numerical approximation with a generic loss often leads to large errors. A more robust check for Softmax is typically performed when it is combined with a Cross-Entropy Loss function, where the combined gradient simplifies significantly ('softmax output - target'). Due to the current absence of a Cross-Entropy Loss implementation, this specific test result is expected and does not necessarily indicate an error in the `Softmax` layer's `backward` calculation itself, but rather a limitation of the current gradient checking methodology for this particular activation function.

## Conclusion

The `Dense`, `ReLU`, and `Sigmoid` layers' implementations, including their `forward` and `backward` passes, have been successfully verified through unit tests and gradient checks. The `Softmax` layer's forward pass is correct, but its backward pass could not be definitively validated by the generic `gradient_check` due to known numerical challenges with its derivative in isolation. Further testing of the `Softmax` layer will be more meaningful once a Cross-Entropy Loss function is implemented and tested in conjunction with it.

Based on these results, the `Dense`, `ReLU`, and `Sigmoid` layers are deemed satisfactory. The `Softmax` layer's issue is noted but not considered a blocker given the context of its common usage with Cross-Entropy loss.
