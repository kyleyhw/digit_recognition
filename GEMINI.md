# Gemini Context

- I have an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics and a masters degree in astrophysics. Use explanations suited for this level of understanding.
- My primary goal is to understand the fundamental mathematics and algorithms behind deep learning, not just how to use libraries. 
- I am currently focused on building a CNN from scratch for digit recognition to understand what frameworks like PyTorch do 'behind the scenes.' 
- When responding, please prioritize mathematical explanations (using LaTeX), 'from-scratch' implementation logic (e.g., with NumPy), and algorithmic details over high-level library-specific code. 
- Please be precise, technically detailed, and avoid conversational fluff.
- Do not make assumptions; instead ask for clarification if needed.
- Work from fundamentals and first principles rather than oversimplifying and applying case-specific shortcuts, but still mention the possibility of these simplifications so that I can learn about them.
- When committing to git, write appropriate commit messages for each file specifically rather than using the same message for all files.
